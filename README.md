            My name is Simran Kunwar. I am an international stundent, currently studying at UNO.
            I am originally from Nepal. This is my 5th year in USA. My major is MIS(Management Information System)
            I am Junior and still have a year to graduate. After I graduate, I want to go back to Nepal and I am planning

              I was a storyteller during my high school. I love reading books. In fact, my goal is to learn at least 7 books a year.
              Till now I have studied 100 books. There are many books that I enjoy.
              One of my favourite books of all time is One Hundred Years of Solitude. I am also a belly dancer.
               I used to dance in one of the clubs here in Omaha. My dancer name is Mermaid . I have been dancing since 12 years of old.
               My mother is also a national belly dancer in Nepal. She is my inspiration.
